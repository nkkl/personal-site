				<h3>helloworld</h3>

				<p>Inspired by an article on why women don't learn to code, I asked my friends about their own experiences learning programming. The answers I got inspired me to create <a href="http://helloworld.nicoleblee.com">a place for people to post their stories</a>. I'm currently working on growing this into a space where people can share their subjective experiences and opinions on a variety of curated topics.</p>

				<h3>Arrived.</h3>
			
				<h4>Advanced Interaction Design, Winter 2012</h4>
				
				<p>Arrived. was designed for the Microsoft Expo 2012 challenge "Information in My World". We developed a device agnostic system that combines mapping systems, events, and contacts to help users get where they are going with minimal stress. Real-time information and smart predictions are used to dynamically generate routes and handle delays, to let users get where they want, when they want, how they want.</p>

				<h3>Mamalode</h3>
		
				<h4>User-Centered Design, Fall 2011</h4>
				
				<p>Mamalode is a print magazine focused on supporting and networking current and expecting mothers. The goal of this project was to help Mamalode explore digital content distribution, in the form of an iPad magazine application. The final deliverable was a design specification/user research report and an interactive prototype (constructed with HTML, CSS, and javascript).</p>

				<h3>Olin-Draper AGV</h3>
		
				<h4>Senior Capstone Program in Engineering, 2009-2010</h4>
				
				<p>The Olin-Drapor AGV was an Olin College <a href="http://scope.olin.edu/about/">SCOPE</a> project to design and build an offroad robotics research platform for Draper Laboratory. We built the base hardware platform and developed proof of concept autonomous behaviors. The final goal was to autonomously follow GPS waypoints with half meter accuracy while preventing collisions.</p>

				<h3>Home Entertainment Systems</h3>
		
				<h4>Human Factors & Interface Design, Spring 2009</h4>
				
				<p>This home entertainment system redesign was done for Olin College's Human Factors and Interface Design course in the Spring of 2009. The focus of the project was on simplifying experience of using a home entertainment system, driving strongly towards a goal-centric interface instead of the current task-centric interaction.</p>

				<h3>One Velociraptor Per Child</h3>
				
				<h4>Independent Web Design, Fall 2008</h4>
				<p>Most of the nearly two billion children in the developing world have inadequate access to dinosaurs. Some receive no paleontology training at all. One in three has never even seen a dinosaur in person. The <a href="http://www.velociraptorz.org">One Velociraptor Per Child</a> project set out to fix this dire situation.</p>

				<p>(OVPC was a collaboration with the esteemed <a href="http://grgmrr.com/">Greg Marra</a>)</p>
