		<h1>12 months of giving</h1>

		<p>I&apos;m giving a thousand dollars to charity every month, for a year, and my friends are helping me. It&apos;s a pretty simple deal: they advocate for causes and I provide the money.</p>

			<h3>What is Urban ArtWorks?</h3>

			<p><a href="http://urbanartworks.org/">Urban ArtWorks</a> is a non-profit organization which helps connect at-risk youth in Seattle with opportunities to create positive and legal public art.</p>

			<h3>Why are you excited about them?</h3>

			<p>I found out about Urban ArtWorks last summer when I was planning to <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/13203-community-paint-by-number-mural">paint a mural based on a grant from the Awesome Foundation</a>. I knew nothing about murals but the staff at Urban helped me to get in touch with an artist and estimate the supplies that I would need to complete the project. They were there every step of the way during the project. After working with Urban first hand, I was able to see the difference that they make in the community as well as in the lives of many teens through the use of public art. They truly care about the lives of their students and are able to help them get on the right track with an outstanding success rate. And, as a result, everyone in Seattle gets some pretty great art to look at all over the city!</p>

			<h3>What did you do to win me over?</h3>

			<p>I promised to fly to Seattle (from Brooklyn) and volunteer my time to participate in the project that the grant will help support. Hopefully in November or early next year.</p>

	<div class="why">
		<h2>Why I&apos;m doing this</h2>

		<p>My parents have given money to charity as long as I can remember. I&apos;ve been donating money to causes I believe in since I became financially independent after college. As graduate school is not exactly a lucrative endeavor, my giving has previously been limited to <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org">The Awesome Foundation</a> and <a href="http://olin.edu">my alma mater</a>. Now that I am gainfully employed, I can easily afford to give a lot more than that. The original idea was to create a list of charities and pledge a monthly sum to each one &ndash; simple and effective philanthropy.</p>

		<p>One day I had an idea: what if I got my friends involved? While I assume that many of my friends give to charity, I don&apos;t actually know if that&apos;s true because they don&apos;t talk about their giving. In fact, I have no idea what causes most of them care about! And of the few friends who are vocal about their giving, I have no idea how much they donate. I am pretty passionate about philanthropy (I do <a href="http://awesomeseattle.org">run a foundation</a>, after all) and I believe that we need a lot more public dialogue about giving.</p>

		<p>So, I&apos;m putting my money where my mouth is: I&apos;ll donate a thousand dollars of my own money every month for a year if the people around me will tell me what causes they care about and why. In addition to letting them tell me where I should give, I also want to know how much my friends are willing to do to win me over. Will they bribe me? Try to persuade me with rational conversation? Offer to match my donation (with money or volunteer hours)? Find some other way to pay it forward?</p>

		<p>On top of giving people a platform to show exactly how much they care about these causes, it also makes the process a lot more fun. And I firmly believe that philanthropy should be fun for everyone involved.</p>
