		<h1>12 months of giving</h1>

		<p>I&apos;m giving a thousand dollars to charity every month, for a year, and my friends are helping me. It&apos;s a pretty simple deal: they advocate for causes and I provide the money.</p>

			<h3>What is Urban ArtWorks?</h3>

			<p><a href="http://urbanartworks.org/">Urban ArtWorks</a> is a non-profit organization which helps connect at-risk youth in Seattle with opportunities to create positive and legal public art.</p>

			<h3>Why are you excited about them?</h3>

			<p>I found out about Urban ArtWorks last summer when I was planning to <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org/en/projects/13203-community-paint-by-number-mural">paint a mural based on a grant from the Awesome Foundation</a>. I knew nothing about murals but the staff at Urban helped me to get in touch with an artist and estimate the supplies that I would need to complete the project. They were there every step of the way during the project. After working with Urban first hand, I was able to see the difference that they make in the community as well as in the lives of many teens through the use of public art. They truly care about the lives of their students and are able to help them get on the right track with an outstanding success rate. And, as a result, everyone in Seattle gets some pretty great art to look at all over the city!</p>

			<h3>What did you do to win me over?</h3>

			<p>I promised to fly to Seattle (from Brooklyn) and volunteer my time to participate in the project that the grant will help support. Hopefully in November or early next year.</p>

			<h3>How can other people donate to Urban Artworks?</h3>
			<p>Anyone interested can <a  href="http://urbanartworks.org/get-involved/">donate online</a> or mail a check:</p>

			<h3>What is Seattle Young People&apos;s Project?</h3>

			<p><a href="http://sypp.org/">Seattle Young People&apos;s Project</a> is a youth-led organization that aims to empower young people in the political process and teach life-long advocacy skills. They focus on social justice issues with a particular emphasis on issues that impact youth. Their programs include an introduction to organizing for youth, anti-oppression workshops, and support for queer youth.</p>

			<h3>Why are you excited about them?</h3>

			<p>SYPP excites me because there is nothing like harnessing the enthusiasm of young people to make change. As a person who has worked in the education field both in a teaching role and in an advocacy role, I have had the privilege of experiencing the passionate thinking of young people from a range of backgrounds. SYPP offers a unique outlet for that passion. Unlike many programs for young people, SYPP is youth-led, which means youth-aged members get to make decisions, receive support from allied adults, and learn about the consequences of their advocacy in a powerful way. It&apos;s a level of trust that young people crave and that they deserve. It&apos;s also very rare.</p>

			<p>I also love SYPP because it reminds me of how important advocacy was to me as a high school student. Being part of a social justice club in my high school taught me so much about the way people work together to create change. The lessons I learned then gave me confidence to speak out about issues that I cared about and gave me courage to speak up at key moments in my life. It was an experience that shaped me. SYPP&apos;s programs offer the opportunity for that kind of experience to hundreds of youth in the Seattle area.</p>

			<p>SYPP excites me because it trusts youth with their power. It lets young people speak up for themselves and others so that they can make change now, and so that they can grow into adults who speak up. SYPP is part of building an engaged society, and I think that's an exciting thing to support.</p>

			<h3>What did you do to win me over?</h3>

			<p>In addition to having talked your ear off about them before, I intended to win you over to the SYPP side with a homemade meal and further discussion of their awesomeness. While these events are still pending, I think the promise of delicious food and swaying conversation may have just made the deal.</p>

			<h3>How can other people donate to SYPP?</h3>

			<h3>What is the Humane Society?</h3>

			<p><a href="http://www.humanesociety.org/">The Humane Society</a> is a group that works to protect and advocate for the animal members of the community through rescue, public policy, and their well-known shelter programs. The society&apos;s efforts impact thousands of animals directly each year, and many many more indirectly with policy reform and support for pet owners and adopters.</p>

			<h3>Why are you excited about them?</h3>

			<p>Animals make people happy. And people can make animals happy, so that they can keep making more people happy. I think it&apos;s awesome that there are people working to keep infrastructure in place to ensure that animals are happy and that people can easily and safely adopt them to optimize happiness all around.  The efforts of the Humane Society help thousands of animals each year to stay happy and healthy, but there are still thousands more pets in abusive conditions or abandoned and unloved. Without donations the Society will be unable to continue to expand rescue and shelter operations which can help these animals. I&apos;m excited about what they already do to pair up loving families and homeless pets, and I think it would be great to see more of this happen (for people whose landlords allow pets).</p>

			<h3>What did you do to win me over?</h3>

			<p>Bread!  An assortment of styles, baked randomly but not less than once per week for a month, and delivered to your doorstep (warm if practical).</p>

			<h3>How can other people donate to the Humane Society?</h3>
			<p>Anyone interested can <a  href="https://secure.humanesociety.org/site/Donation2?df_id=1514&1514.donation=form1&s_src=webdn_topnavD1514">donate online</a> or mail a check made out to &ldquo;The HSUS&rdquo; to:</p>

			<h3>What is Women&apos;s Enterprises International?</h3>

			<p><a href="https://womensenterprises.org/">Women&apos;s Enterprises International</a> is a nonprofit that works with women in developing countries to address the systemic challenges of poverty, such as the lack of education and business capital.</p>

			<h3>Why are you excited about them?</h3>

			<p>My favorite WEI project is Catch the Rain, which helps to provide water tanks to women in an extremely arid region of Kenya.  WEI matches funds raised by these women so they can collect clean rainwater in a tank instead of walking five hours each day to carry water&mdash;which may be dirty and non-potable&mdash;to their families.  Not only is the matching aspect of the project empowering for the women, they can then use the time they save to start businesses and send their children to school, healthier for having clean water to drink.</p>

			<h3>What did you do to win me over?</h3>

			<p>I matched your donation twice: once with my own money and once through my employer's charitable matching program!</p>

			<p>My parents have given money to charity as long as I can remember. I&apos;ve been donating money to causes I believe in since I became financially independent after college. Since graduate school is not exactly a lucrative endeavor, my giving has previously been limited to <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org">The Awesome Foundation</a> and <a href="http://olin.edu">my alma mater</a>. Now that I am gainfully employed, I can easily afford to give a lot more than that. My original idea was to create a list of charities and pledge a monthly sum to each one &ndash; simple and effective philanthropy.</p>

			<p>One day I had an idea: what if I got my friends involved? While I assume that many of my friends give to charity, I don&apos;t actually know if that&apos;s true because they don&apos;t talk about their giving. In fact, I have no idea what causes most of them care about! And of the few friends who are vocal about their giving, I have no idea how much they donate. I am pretty passionate about philanthropy (I do <a href="http://awesomeseattle.org">run a foundation</a>, after all) and I believe that we need a lot more public dialogue about giving.</p>

			<p>So, I&apos;m putting my money where my mouth is: I&apos;ll donate a thousand dollars of my own money every month for a year if the people around me will tell me what causes they care about and why. In addition to letting them tell me where I should give, I also want to know how much my friends are willing to do to win me over. Will they bribe me? Try to persuade me with rational conversation? Offer to match my donation (with money or volunteer hours)? Find some other way to pay it forward?</p>

			<p>On top of giving people a platform to show exactly how much they care about these causes, it also makes the process a lot more fun. And I firmly believe that philanthropy should be fun for everyone involved.</p>
