		<h1>12 months of giving</h1>

		<p>I&apos;m giving a thousand dollars to charity every month, for a year, and my friends are helping me. It&apos;s a pretty simple deal: they advocate for causes and I provide the money.</p>

		<h2>Why I&apos;m doing this</h2>

		<p>My parents have given money to charity as long as I can remember. I&apos;ve been donating money to causes I believe in since I became financially independent after college. As graduate school is not exactly a lucrative endeavor, my giving has previously been limited to <a href="http://www.awesomefoundation.org">The Awesome Foundation</a> and <a href="http://olin.edu">my alma mater</a>. Now that I am gainfully employed, I can easily afford to give a lot more than that. The original idea was to create a list of charities and pledge a monthly sum to each one &ndash; simple and effective philanthropy.</p>

		<p>One day I had an idea: what if I got my friends involved? While I assume that many of my friends give to charity, I don&apos;t actually know if that&apos;s true because they don&apos;t talk about their giving. In fact, I have no idea what causes most of them care about! And of the few friends who are vocal about their giving, I have no idea how much they donate. I am pretty passionate about philanthropy (I do <a href="http://awesomeseattle.org">run a foundation</a>, after all) and I believe that we need a lot more public dialogue about giving.</p>

		<p>So, I&apos;m putting my money where my mouth is: I&apos;ll donate a thousand dollars of my own money every month for a year if the people around me will tell me what causes they care about and why. In addition to letting them tell me where I should give, I also want to know how much my friends are willing to do to win me over. Will they bribe me? Try to persuade me with rational conversation? Offer to match my donation (with money or volunteer hours)? Find some other way to pay it forward?</p>

		<p>On top of giving people a platform to show exactly how much they care about these causes, it also makes the process a lot more fun. And I firmly believe that philanthropy should be fun for everyone involved.</p>
